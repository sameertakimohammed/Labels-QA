# Golden QA — Starkist Label In-Process Inspection System

A tablet-first quality-inspection app for the Starkist paper-label line. Operators and QA
Officers capture each of the four production stages on a tablet; every record is keyed to one
**Job #**, and typing a Job # returns the full cross-stage quality record.

Built to run on an **on-premise server** with **zero external dependencies** (Node.js only).

---

## 1. Quick start (on-prem server)

1. Install **Node.js 18+** on the server (https://nodejs.org).
2. Copy this `Golden-QA-App` folder onto the server.
3. From a terminal in this folder, run:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

4. You'll see: `Golden QA server on http://0.0.0.0:3000`.
5. On any tablet on the same network, open **http://<server-ip>:3000** (e.g. http://192.168.1.50:3000).

To keep it running after logoff, install it as a service (Windows: `nssm`, or Task Scheduler;
Linux: `systemd` or `pm2`). See section 7.

### Default sign-ins (change before go-live)
| User | Role | PIN |
|------|------|-----|

| R. Prasad | Supervisor | 2345 |
| Ateet Roshan | Quality Manager | 9999 |
| Administrator | Administrator | 0000 |

## 2. Using it on a tablet

- Open the URL in Chrome/Edge/Safari, then **Add to Home Screen** — it installs as an app
  (full-screen, large touch targets).
- After the first load it works **offline**; data entered offline is **queued and synced**
  automatically when the network returns (watch the dot in the top-right: green = online).
- **Scan** the Job # barcode with the camera (📷), **snap defect photos**, and **sign** on screen.

---

## 3. The four stages (forms digitised)

1. **Printing** — F-040-A / F-016-E / F-027-A (machine chosen at job creation)
2. **Reel Inspection** — F-021 (per-roll defect & waste log; AVT import)
3. **Sheeting / Slitting** — PRD002
4. **Finishing & Release** — F-038-A (mandatory hourly checks, final release decision)

---

## 4. Configuration — `config.json`

| Key | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| `port` / `host` | Server address (default 3000 on all interfaces) |
| `sso` | Microsoft 365 sign-in. Stub accepts any `@golden.com.fj`; replace `verifySso()` in `server.js` with real Entra ID token validation for production |
| `businessCentral` | Set `enabled:true` and confirm `jobService` (the published OData web service holding the print Job# + item). The server queries `bc-test.gml.com.fj` directly — run it on a host that can reach BC |
| `notify` | Paste a **Teams Incoming Webhook URL** and/or SMTP details to get hold/reject alerts |
| `tolerances` | COF range, registration max, barcode min grade — drive the auto pass/fail flags (also editable in Admin) |

---

## 5. Integrations

- **Business Central**: `integrations/businessCentral.js` queries BC14 OData V4 by Job #.
  Until enabled it returns sample data so the UI works. Confirm the exact service name with
  your BC admin and set `businessCentral.enabled=true`.
- **AVT reel report**: Stage 2 → *Import AVT report (CSV)*. Expected headers (any order):
  `Roll, TotalMeters, WasteIn, WasteOut, Defect, WeightKg`.
- **Alerts**: hold/reject events call `integrations/notify.js` (Teams webhook now; SMTP email
  hook ready to wire to your relay).

---

## 6. Data, backup & database

- All data lives in `data/db.json`; uploaded photos/signatures in `data/uploads/`.
- **Back up the `data/` folder** on a schedule (it is the system of record).
- The storage layer is deliberately simple and **swappable**. For higher volume/concurrency,
  replace the `loadDB`/`saveDB` functions with **PostgreSQL** (recommended) or **SQLite**
  (`node:sqlite`). The data shapes already map cleanly to tables: `jobs`, `stage1..4`, `users`,
  `audit`, `masterdata`.

---

## 7. Production hardening checklist

- [ ] Change all default PINs (Admin > Users / edit `seedDB`), set strong manager PINs.
- [ ] Put the server behind **HTTPS** (reverse proxy: IIS/ARR, nginx, or Caddy) so the camera
      and PWA install work reliably and credentials are encrypted.
- [ ] Replace the SSO stub with real **Microsoft Entra ID** validation.
- [ ] Run as a service (pm2 / systemd / Windows service) with auto-restart.
- [ ] Move to **PostgreSQL** and schedule **backups** of the database + `uploads/`.
- [ ] Confirm the **Business Central** web service and enable it.
- [ ] Set the **SQF document-retention** period and confirm with your auditor.
